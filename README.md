  *When is a measure finished?*
  
  A measure is complete once you've:
  - Written the measure and tested it with the OpenStudio App to confirm it performs as expected
  - Written measure tests for a range of use cases with both good and bad measure arguments
  - Generated the measure.xml file and written informative user and modeler descriptions
  - Included a README file and any other documentation
