## Purpose
Community development and discussion of OpenStudio Measures.

## Contributing

### Report a bug or request a feature in an existing measure
 - [Submit an issue](https://github.com/BuildingPerformanceSimulation/openstudio-measures/issues) on the issues tab.  Tag your issue as a *bug* for bugs and *enhancement* for feature requests.

### Write a measure
 - Join or request to be added as a contributor to this GitHub repository.  You can post in our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/BuildingPerformanceSimulation/openstudio-measures) to be added.
 - Create a new branch *new/my_measure* forked from the develop branch and work on your measure there.  When finished, submit a pull request to the develop branch.  Once merged, you or an admin can upload it to [BCL](bcl.nrel.gov).
 
  *When is a measure finished?*
  
  A measure is complete once you've:
  - Written the measure and tested it with the OpenStudio App to confirm it performs as expected
  - Written measure tests for a range of use cases with both good and bad measure arguments
  - Generated the measure.xml file and written informative user and modeler descriptions
  - Included a README file and any other documentation
